INSTRUCTIONS:
  First, you have to define what the size of your 
  board will be and the percentage of tiles that 
  will be bombs. It's reccommended to have an 
  equal width (x-axis), height (y-axis), and 
  depth (z/vertical-axis).

  Personally, I like a size 3 board with 20% bombs.

  After the setup is complete, the board will be 
  printed out looking similar to this depending 
  on your size. This board will be size 3.

        3       
        Y

  Enter the layer: 


  You can see at the bottom, its asking for the 
  layer. This will be the depth (z-axis) of the 
  tile you will uncover.

  It will then ask for the X coordinate 
  (width-wise) of the tile.

  Then, it will ask the Y coordinate (the height 
  of each layer).

  Finally, it will ask if you want to put a flag
  on this tile or not. If you do want to place a
  flag you can enter: y, f, or 1. If you don't
  want to place a flag you can enter: n, or 2.

  To win, uncover every non-bomb tile.

  Have fun!
